fastspawn

fork(2) calls slow down as the parent process uses more memory due to the need
to copy page tables. In many common uses of fork(), where it is followed
immediately by one of the exec family of functions to spawn child processes
(Kernel#system, IO::popen, Process::spawn, etc.), it's possible to remove this
overhead through the use of special kernel interfaces.

The fastspawn library aims to implement a subset of the Ruby 1.9 Process::spawn
interface in a way that takes advantage of fast process spawning interfaces when
available and provide sane fallbacks on systems that do not.

STATUS

This is largely a proof of concept project at this point.
